### How do you execute your go projects?

Maybe your first option is:
* Execute with go run <main>
* I have a Makefile, so I only need to run make build

The previous isnâ€™t bad, it works but you lost time in start, stop the process, move to the terminal, etc.

I present [AIR](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) that reloads your changes when you codding. Air it's used in your machine or inside the docker.

Happy coding!
